# Covid-19 and Economic Status of the Globe
# A study on covid-19 and its correlation with GDP, HDI and poverty rate across countries
Data analysis project aiming to evaluate the correlation between HDI, GDP per capita and covid mortality rates.

The following work was assigned to us as the term project for CSE0448 Big Data Analytics at IKU for the 2021-2022 Fall semester.
The topic of the project was, as written in the project description:
- The Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on the Global Economy: Emphasis on Poverty Alleviation and Economic Growth

The project, in accordance with the project description seeks to evaluate the correlations between human development index (HDI), GDP of a given country and the poverty rate with the mortality rate of Covid-19 in the given country.
Throughout this project, the aim is to:
- Evaluate the correlations of Covid-19 mortality rate with economic factors
- Evaluate the correlations of Covid-19 mortality rate with HDI
- Unravel any unexpected correlations
- Extract information from the data at hand
- Visualize the extracted information
- Build a categorical prediction model using machine learning
